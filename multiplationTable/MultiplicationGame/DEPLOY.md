# How to Publish Your Game to the World 🌍

Since you want to make this a **Global Website** (accessible to everyone on the internet), here is the easiest way to do it for free, without needing to install any tools.

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest)
1. Open this folder in your File Explorer: `c:\Users\stustu\Documents\gitHub\KIC-start\multiplationTable\MultiplicationGame`
2. Go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) in your browser.
3. Drag and drop the `MultiplicationGame` folder onto the page.
4. Wait a few seconds, and Netlify will give you a **public link** (e.g., `https://random-name-1234.netlify.app`).
5. You can now share this link with anyone in the world!

## Option 2: GitHub Pages
Since you have a GitHub folder, if you push this code to GitHub:
1. Go to your Repository Settings.
2. Go to "Pages".
3. Select "Deploy from branch" -> "main" (or master) -> "/root" (or the specific folder).
4. Save.

## Enjoy your global website! 🚀
